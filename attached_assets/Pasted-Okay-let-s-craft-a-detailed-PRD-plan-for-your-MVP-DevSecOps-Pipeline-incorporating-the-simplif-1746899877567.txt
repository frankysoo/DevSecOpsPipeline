**[MVP DevSecOps Pipeline V1.0] - Product Requirements Document**

*   **Version:** 1.0 (MVP)
*   **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
*   **Author(s):** [Your Name/Team]
*   **Status:** Draft
*   **Stakeholders:** Développeur Agile (Représentant), Ingénieur Opérationnel (Représentant), Ingénieur Sécurité (Représentant), [Product Owner/Project Lead]

**1. Introduction & Purpose**
    *   **1.1. Problem Statement:**
        *   "Current software development suffers from slow feedback on code quality and basic security hygiene, manual steps in building and testing, and a lack of early visibility into common vulnerabilities. This hinders developer productivity and introduces preventable risks."
    *   **1.2. Proposed Solution (MVP Overview):**
        *   "To implement a foundational DevSecOps pipeline (V1.0) that automates code integration, building, unit/integration testing, and performs essential automated security checks (SCA and SAST) for a pilot application, culminating in automated deployment to a staging environment."
    *   **1.3. Goals & Objectives (MVP):**
        *   "Provide developers with actionable feedback on code compilability, test results, and critical/high SAST/SCA vulnerabilities within X minutes of a commit to the pilot application's repository."
        *   "Automate the build and unit/integration testing process for the pilot application."
        *   "Automatically scan the pilot application for known vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies (SCA) and critical static code vulnerabilities (SAST)."
        *   "Automate the deployment of the pilot application's successfully built and scanned artifact to a designated staging environment."
        *   "Establish a foundational 'Pipeline as Code' practice for the pilot application."
    *   **1.4. Target Audience / User Personas (Focus for MVP):**
        *   **Développeur Agile (Primary):** Needs fast, actionable feedback on their code.
        *   **Ingénieur Sécurité (Secondary):** Needs assurance that baseline security scans are running and critical issues are flagged.
        *   **Ingénieur Opérationnel (Secondary):** Benefits from automated builds and staging deployments, reducing manual effort.

**2. User Stories & Use Cases (MVP Scope)**
    *   **2.1 User Stories (MVP):**
        *   *US-MVP-001:* As a Développeur Agile, I want to commit my code and have it automatically built and unit/integration tested, so that I get immediate feedback on code correctness. (Relates to UC-001)
        *   *US-MVP-002:* As a Développeur Agile, I want my committed code to be automatically scanned for critical vulnerabilities in dependencies (SCA) and static code analysis (SAST), so that I can address security issues early. (Relates to UC-002, UC-003)
        *   *US-MVP-003:* As a Développeur Agile, I want to easily understand why a pipeline stage (build, test, scan) failed, so that I can quickly fix the problem. (Relates to UC-013)
        *   *US-MVP-004:* As an Ingénieur Opérationnel, I want the application artifact to be automatically built and stored upon successful tests and scans, so that a consistent, quality-checked artifact is available. (Relates to UC-003, UC-004)
        *   *US-MVP-005:* As a Développeur Agile/Ingénieur Opérationnel, I want the successfully built and scanned artifact to be automatically deployed to the staging environment, so that we can perform further testing and validation. (Relates to UC-007 for Staging)
        *   *US-MVP-006:* As an Ingénieur Sécurité, I want to be notified (or have access to reports) of critical SAST/SCA findings from the pipeline, so that I can track and advise on remediation. (Relates to UC-013)
        *   *US-MVP-007:* As an Ingénieur Opérationnel/Sécurité, I want the pipeline configuration for the pilot application to be defined in code, so that it's versioned and auditable. (Relates to UC-014 simplified)
    *   **2.2. Use Cases (MVP Focus - Subset of original UCs, simplified):**
        *   **UC-MVP-001: Submit, Build, and Test Code** (Based on original UC-001, focusing on build and unit/integration tests)
        *   **UC-MVP-002: Execute Basic Security Scans (SCA & SAST)** (Combines simplified aspects of UC-002 and security parts of UC-003. No DAST yet.)
        *   **UC-MVP-003: Build and Store Application Artifact** (Based on original UC-003 for building, and UC-004 for storing a tagged artifact/image.)
        *   **UC-MVP-004: Deploy Application to Staging** (Based on original UC-007, scoped to Staging environment only.)
        *   **UC-MVP-005: Consult Basic Pipeline Reports & Notifications** (Simplified UC-013, focusing on CI/CD tool's native capabilities and essential failure/critical finding notifications.)
        *   **UC-MVP-006: Define Pilot App Pipeline Configuration as Code** (Simplified UC-014, focused on the pipeline script for one app.)
        *   *(Detailed descriptions for these MVP UCs will follow the structure of your original UC-001 example, but with reduced scope and complexity where noted.)*

            *   *Scénario Nominal (Backend):* CI agent invokes SAST tool (e.g., SonarScanner CLI with connection to SonarCloud/basic SonarQube, Semgrep CLI with core ruleset) on source code; tool generates report. Pipeline parses report for critical/high findings.
            *   *Critères d'Acceptation:* SAST scan runs automatically; report accessible (e.g., link to SonarQube/SonarCloud, or artifacted report); pipeline can be configured to fail/alert on critical/high severity vulnerabilities.
        *   **FR-MVP-05: Application Artifact Creation & Storage:**
            *   *Description:* Upon successful build, tests, and scans (as per configured policy), the pipeline backend must package the application (e.g., JAR, WAR, Docker image) and store it in a designated artifact repository with appropriate tagging (e.g., git commit hash).
            *   *Scénario Nominal (Backend):* CI agent executes packaging command (e.g., `docker build`, `mvn package`), pushes artifact to repository (e.g., Docker Registry, Nexus).
            *   *Critères d'Acceptation:* Artifact is built and versioned; artifact is stored in the configured repository.
        *   **FR-MVP-06: Automated Deployment to Staging Environment:**
            *   *Description:* The pipeline backend must automatically deploy the versioned application artifact to a predefined staging environment.
            *   *Scénario Nominal (Backend):* CI agent executes deployment script/commands targeting staging (e.g., `kubectl apply -f <manifests>`, `scp` and restart, simple PaaS deploy command).
            *   *Critères d'Acceptation:* Application is deployed to staging; basic deployment success/failure status is clear.
        *   **FR-MVP-07: Basic Pipeline Notifications:**

            *   *Scénario Nominal (Backend):* CI server uses built-in notification mechanisms (email, Slack integration) to send alerts.
            *   *Critères d'Acceptation:* Developers are notified of failures related to their commits; Security team is notified of critical findings.
        *   **FR-MVP-08: Pipeline as Code for Pilot Application:**
            *   *Description:* The pipeline definition (stages, steps, tool invocations) for the pilot application must be stored as code within the application's SCM repository.
            *   *Scénario Nominal (Backend):* CI server reads and interprets a pipeline script (e.g., `Jenkinsfile`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `azure-pipelines.yml`) from the repo.
            *   *Critères d'Acceptation:* Pipeline execution is driven by a version-controlled script.
    *   **3.2. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs - MVP Focus):**

            *   *NFR-MVP-1.1:* Feedback loop (commit to build, test, SAST/SCA results) for the pilot app should ideally be under 15-20 minutes.
        *   *NFR-MVP-02: Usability (for Developers):*
            *   *NFR-MVP-2.1:* Pipeline failure messages must be clear and link to relevant logs within the CI/CD tool.
            *   *NFR-MVP-2.2:* Accessing SAST/SCA reports should be straightforward (e.g., link in build output, downloadable artifact).
        *   *NFR-MVP-03: Security (of the Pipeline itself):*
            *   *NFR-MVP-3.1:* Credentials used by the pipeline (e.g., to access SCM, artifact repository) must be stored securely within the CI/CD system's secrets management.
        *   *NFR-MVP-04: Reliability:*
            *   *NFR-MVP-4.1:* The pipeline should execute consistently for the pilot application.
    *   **3.3. UI/UX Requirements (Leverage CI/CD Tool):**
        *   "The primary interface for interacting with and observing the pipeline will be the chosen CI/CD platform's native UI."
        *   "Pipeline stages (build, test, SAST, SCA, deploy-staging) must be clearly visualized in the CI/CD UI."

        *   Automated deployment to a single, predefined **staging environment**.
        *   Basic notifications via CI/CD tool's native capabilities.
        *   Secrets managed by the CI/CD tool's built-in mechanism.
    *   **4.2. Out of Scope (for MVP V1.0 - Defer to Future Versions):**
        *   DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing).
        *   Advanced Image Scanning (beyond basic SCA if image includes OS packages).
        *   Comprehensive Infrastructure Security Scanning (IaC scanning).
        *   Automated deployment to Production environments.
        *   Complex deployment strategies (Blue/Green, Canary).
        *   Full-fledged Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for provisioning application environments (beyond maybe pipeline agents).

**How to "Do It" (Create and Implement This MVP PRD):**

1.  **Finalize Tool Selection (Crucial First Step):**
    *   **CI/CD Orchestrator:** Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, etc. This choice heavily influences how "Pipeline as Code" is done.
    *   **SCA Tool:** Snyk, OWASP Dependency-Check, Trivy (for libraries), GitHub Dependabot, etc. Consider ease of integration and reporting.
    *   **SAST Tool:** SonarQube/SonarCloud, Semgrep, Checkmarx (if budget), Codacy, etc. Consider language support, ruleset customizability, and integration.
    *   **Artifact Repository:** Docker Hub, Nexus, Artifactory, GitLab/GitHub/Azure built-in registries.
2.  **Select Pilot Application:** Choose an application that is:
    *   Relatively simple but representative.
    *   Actively developed.
    *   Has a team willing to collaborate.
    *   Ideally has some existing tests.
3.  **Set Up Core Infrastructure:**
    *   Install/configure the CI/CD orchestrator.
    *   Set up agents/runners if needed.
    *   Ensure network access between components.
    *   Provision the staging environment.
4.  **Iteratively Build the Pipeline (Follow FR-MVP sequence):**
    *   **Phase 1 (CI Basics - FR-MVP-01, FR-MVP-02):**
        *   Get the pilot app to check out, build, and run unit/integration tests automatically in the CI/CD tool.
        *   Implement "Pipeline as Code" (FR-MVP-08) from the start for these basic steps.
    *   **Phase 2 (Artifacting - FR-MVP-05):**
        *   Package the application (e.g., Docker image) and push it to the artifact repository.
    *   **Phase 3 (Security Scans - FR-MVP-03, FR-MVP-04):**
        *   Integrate the chosen SCA tool. Configure it to report/alert on critical/highs.
        *   Integrate the chosen SAST tool. Configure it similarly. This might take tuning.
    *   **Phase 4 (Deployment to Staging - FR-MVP-06):**
        *   Write and test scripts/configurations to deploy the artifact from the repository to the staging environment.
    *   **Phase 5 (Notifications & Polish - FR-MVP-07):**
        *   Configure basic notifications for success/failure.
        *   Ensure logs and reports are accessible.
        *   Refine pipeline scripts.
5.  **Detailed Use Case Elaboration:** As you implement each phase, fully detail the corresponding MVP Use Cases (UC-MVP-001 to UC-MVP-006) with pre-conditions, main flow, post-conditions, and alternative flows, specifically for the tools and processes you're implementing.
6.  **Continuous Collaboration and Feedback:**
    *   Work closely with the pilot application's developers. Get their feedback on usability, report clarity, and performance.
    *   Consult with security SMEs on SAST/SCA tool configuration and finding interpretation.
7.  **Document as You Go:** Don't leave documentation to the end. Document:
    *   How to onboard a (similar) new application (even if it's just notes for now).
    *   How to troubleshoot common pipeline failures for the pilot app.
    *   Configuration details of the security tools.
8.  **Test Thoroughly:**
    *   Test each stage of the pipeline.
    *   Test failure conditions (e.g., what happens if tests fail, or a critical vulnerability is found?).
    *   Test the end-to-end flow.

**How to Apply the PRD:**

*   **Guide for Development Sprints/Iterations:** Use the FR-MVPs and UC-MVPs to define tasks for your implementation team.
*   **Communication Tool:** Share this PRD with stakeholders to set expectations for V1.0.
*   **Scope Management:** If new ideas come up, refer to "Out of Scope (for MVP V1.0)" to decide if they should be deferred.
*   **Basis for Testing:** QA (or developers doing testing) will use "Critères d'Acceptation" and Use Case flows to create test cases.
*   **Measure Success:** Track the KPIs defined in section 5 to demonstrate the value of the MVP.

This MVP approach makes the project far more manageable. You'll deliver tangible value quickly, learn from the process, and build a solid foundation for the more comprehensive DevSecOps vision outlined in your original "Étude Fonctionnelle."
