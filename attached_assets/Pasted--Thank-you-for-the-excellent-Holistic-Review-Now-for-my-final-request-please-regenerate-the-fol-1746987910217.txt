"Thank you for the excellent 'Holistic Review.' Now, for my final request, please regenerate the following key components of the 'MVP DevSecOps Pipeline' project, ensuring you directly incorporate ALL the 'Key Best Practice Refinements' you just suggested (Dockerfile changes, SCA suppression argument, enhanced deployment script error handling/health check).

Additionally, as you regenerate these, optimize them for the 'highest performance possible' within the scope of the MVP and ensure all technologies mentioned (GitHub Actions, Node.js/Docker, OWASP DC, SonarCloud, Handlebars, PostgreSQL) are reflected correctly and efficiently in these final versions:

1.  **The complete, consolidated GitHub Actions workflow YAML file:**
    *   Ensure the SCA step includes `args: > --failOnCVSS 7 --suppression dependency-check-suppressions.xml`.
    *   Review for any minor performance optimizations (e.g., caching strategies, parallelization where appropriate without breaking dependencies).
2.  **The `Dockerfile` for the Node.js demo application:**
    *   Implement the specific base image (`node:16.20.2-alpine3.18`) and the non-root user setup you recommended.
    *   Ensure it follows best practices for a performant and secure Node.js Docker image.
3.  **The `scripts/deploy.sh` script:**
    *   Integrate the enhanced error handling and the robust post-deployment health check loop you outlined.
4.  **The `views/onboarding.handlebars` and `public/js/onboarding.js` files:**
    *   While focusing on the backend and pipeline, ensure any logic in `onboarding.js` that generates configurations (like the GitHub Actions YAML or `sonar-project.properties`) reflects the best practices and refinements discussed.
    *   Ensure the Handlebars template clearly presents information and warnings as per our previous discussions for optimal user experience.
5.  **The `src/server.js` (Node.js backend for the demo app):**
    *   Briefly review for any obvious performance bottlenecks or basic security best practices that should be applied for an Express.js application serving the UI and handling the onboarding form (e.g., using `helmet`, proper error handling).

Provide the complete, final code for these specified files, representing the most refined and performant version based on all our discussions and your review. This will serve as the definitive blueprint."
