"Based on ALL the information, YAML, scripts, and configuration files you have generated for the 'MVP DevSecOps Pipeline' (including the consolidated GitHub Actions workflow, the build.sh, test.sh, deploy.sh, notify.sh scripts, and the sonar-project.properties file):

Please generate a single, comprehensive 'MVP DevSecOps Pipeline: Setup & Deployment Guide' document.

This guide should be written as a step-by-step instruction manual for a DevOps engineer to take all the generated components and make the entire pipeline operational for the Node.js/Docker pilot application. It must include, in meticulous detail:

1.  **Prerequisites Checklist:**
    *   List all accounts needed (GitHub, SonarCloud, target staging server access).
    *   List all software to be installed on the staging server (e.g., Docker, SSH server).
2.  **GitHub Repository Setup:**
    *   Step-by-step: How to create the `.github/workflows/pipeline.yml` file and paste the consolidated workflow.
    *   Step-by-step: How to create the `scripts/` directory and each `.sh` file with their content.
    *   Step-by-step: How to create the `sonar-project.properties` file.
    *   Instructions on committing and pushing these files.
3.  **GitHub Secrets Configuration:**
    *   For EACH secret (`SONAR_TOKEN`, `STAGING_SSH_KEY`, `STAGING_HOST`, `STAGING_USER`, `NOTIFICATION_WEBHOOK`):
        *   Where to obtain the value for this secret.
        *   Exact steps on how to add it to GitHub repository secrets.
4.  **SonarCloud Project Configuration:**
    *   Step-by-step: How to create a new project in SonarCloud.
    *   How to link it to the GitHub repository.
    *   Key Quality Gate conditions to set up in the SonarCloud UI to align with the pipeline's goals (e.g., fail on new critical/blocker vulnerabilities, maintain coverage).
5.  **Staging Server Preparation:**
    *   Instructions for ensuring Docker is running.
    *   How to set up the SSH user and ensure key-based authentication works with the key provided in `STAGING_SSH_KEY`.
    *   Any necessary firewall configurations for SSH and the application port (e.g., 3000).
6.  **Pilot Application Considerations:**
    *   Reminder to adapt the placeholder commands in `build.sh` (e.g., `npm run build`) and the `Dockerfile` reference in the `package` job's `docker build` step to match the actual pilot application.
    *   Reminder that the `deploy.sh` script's health check (`curl -s http://localhost:3000/health`) assumes the Node.js app has a `/health` endpoint listening on port 3000.
7.  **Triggering and Verifying the First Pipeline Run:**
    *   How to trigger the pipeline (e.g., push a commit).
    *   What to look for in the GitHub Actions UI logs for each job to verify success.
    *   Where to find uploaded artifacts (test results, SCA report).
    *   How to check SonarCloud for the analysis results.
    *   How to verify the application is running on the staging server.
8.  **Basic Troubleshooting Tips:**
    *   Common failure points for each job and initial diagnostic steps (e.g., "If build fails, check `build.sh` logs for npm errors." "If SonarCloud scan fails, verify `SONAR_TOKEN` and project key.").

Structure this as a clear, actionable guide that someone can follow meticulously to get the pipeline live. Do not summarize; provide detailed, explicit instructions for every step."
