   - Enable GitHub Actions for CI/CD capabilities
   - Configure branch protection for the main branch

2. **Required Secrets Configuration**
   - Set up the following secrets in GitHub repository settings:
     - `SONAR_TOKEN`: For SonarCloud authentication
     - `STAGING_SSH_KEY`: SSH private key for staging deployment
     - `STAGING_HOST`: Hostname for staging environment
     - `STAGING_USER`: Username for SSH access to staging
     - `NOTIFICATION_WEBHOOK`: Webhook URL for notifications

3. **Tool Selection & Configuration**
   - **CI/CD Platform**: GitHub Actions
   - **SCA Tool**: OWASP Dependency Check
   - **SAST Tool**: SonarCloud
   - **Artifact Repository**: GitHub Packages

2. Configure workflow trigger on commits to main branch:
   ```yaml
   on:
     push:
       branches: [ main ]
     pull_request:
       branches: [ main ]
   ```
3. Define the build job with steps to checkout code and build application:
   ```yaml
   jobs:
     build:
       name: Build Application
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - name: Checkout code

## Implementation Plan for Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-MVP-01: Performance

**Implementation Approach:**
1. Implement caching of dependencies and build artifacts to reduce pipeline execution time
2. Configure parallel execution where possible (e.g., running test and security scan jobs simultaneously)
3. Use lightweight Docker images for pipeline runners
4. Monitor and optimize the slowest pipeline steps

**Validation Method:**
- Measure pipeline execution time in GitHub Actions
- Set a baseline and track improvements
- Target completion time: 15-20 minutes or less for the full pipeline

### NFR-MVP-02: Usability (for Developers)

**Implementation Approach:**
1. Ensure clear naming of pipeline stages and steps
2. Include descriptive error messages in scripts
3. Add links to artifacts and reports in GitHub Actions summary
4. Document common failure scenarios and resolutions in README.md

**Validation Method:**
- Get feedback from developers on clarity of pipeline output
- Verify ease of accessing logs and reports
- Confirm that failure messages are actionable

### NFR-MVP-03: Security (of the Pipeline itself)

**Implementation Approach:**
1. Store all credentials as GitHub repository secrets
2. Use least privilege principle for service accounts
3. Implement timeout for pipeline jobs to prevent resource exhaustion
4. Validate inputs in pipeline scripts to prevent injection attacks

**Validation Method:**
- Review security settings of GitHub Actions
- Verify that secrets aren't exposed in logs
- Confirm proper handling of sensitive credentials

### NFR-MVP-04: Reliability

**Implementation Approach:**
1. Add robust error handling in all scripts
2. Implement retry logic for network-dependent operations
3. Use fixed versions for actions and tools to ensure consistency
4. Add validation steps before critical operations (deployment, etc.)

**Validation Method:**
- Monitor pipeline success rate
- Test recovery from common failure scenarios
- Verify consistent behavior across multiple runs
